# Assignment 3
## Recipe with RecyclerView 
**RecipeManager** This assignment is based on the 4.5 homework assignment. You will use RecyclerView to present a list of recipe names and descriptions. Clicking on the recipe will start a new Activity or Fragment that shows the detailed recipe with a name and image at the top of the screen, and below that the ingrediants and directions in a scrollVieww.

* use the MVC pattern
* the model is the given in both Java and Kotlin in the modle folder
* the main activity **must** use RecyclerView
* the items in the RecyclerViiew should use CardView to display each recipe 
* clicking on a recipe in the RecyclerView should launch a second Activity (or Fragment)
* the detail Acitvity should show the image, the ingediants, and the recipe directions. 
* the ingrdiants and directions should have titles
* the ingrediants and directions should be in a scrollView

The image is given to you by the DataProvider in the from of a URL. One of the easiest ways to work with images in Android is with the Picasso library. In order to use the Picasso library you must 

Add the Picasso dependency to your build.gradle (Module: app)  
  	```implementation 'com.squareup.picasso:picasso:2.71828'```   

Add permission to access the internet to your Manifest file 
   ```<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />``` before the <application> tag

To display the image **recipe.image** with the imageView *imageView*.  

```
 Picasso.get()   
.load(recipe.image)
.fit()
.placeholder(R.drawable.ic_launcher_background)
.error(R.drawable.ic_launcher_background)
.into(imageView);
```


* COMMENTS
	* You must have a header comment with your name and the date in every file that you modify
	* Any methods that are not obvious must have comments
	* identifier names, variables, classes, functions, must be descriptive and meaningful
	* Any method that is more than 15 lines long must have comments (hint, if you make your methods shorter you don't need comments)
